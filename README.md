# S3 texture conversion script
S3 texture conversion script for Just Dance 2-4 Wii DLC shops. Ubisoft used .s3 texture files to render the preview images for the songs you were able to buy in the DLC Shop. It is still very WIP (textures are pretty blocky and pixelated) however it does render in the DLC shop of these games.
